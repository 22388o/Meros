#### Current State

Meros is quite close to completion, yet still under development. We frequently run Developer Testnets, where anyone can participate, as long as they compile their own node. This is to ensure participants are able and willing to deal with oddities that may occur during testing. Before mainnet, we will launch a testnet with provided binaries, which anyone can join.

#### Compiling

For guides on how to compile Meros, please see https://github.com/MerosCrypto/Meros/tree/master/docs/Development/Compilation.

#### Contributing

Meros is seeking out developers to contribute to the codebase! If you wish to help out, please feel free to reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nZmdWGA). You can also pick an open issue, ask any questions you have about it, and start writing code directly.
