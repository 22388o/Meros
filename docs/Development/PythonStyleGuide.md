# Python Style Guide

1. Be concise, but never implicit.
2. Use a 4-space ident.
3. Try to remain under 80 characters per line.

4. For variables/class attributes, use pascalCase for naming.
5. For classes/enum attributes, use CamelCase.
6. Use type hints everywhere.

7. Try to always write pure code.
8. Every function definition should place each argument on their own line.
9. When splitting data over multiple lines (function call, tuple, array...), place each value on their own line
10. Comment your code as needed. It is better to comment too much than too little.

11. Pass PyLint.
