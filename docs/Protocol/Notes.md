# Notes

- 1 Meros is equivalent to 10,000,000,000 Meri, and Meri is the lowest denomination of Meros. This means Meros has 10 decimals.
- The used BLS specification is BLS12-381. Meros currently uses Chia's BLS library, yet will move to either Herumi or Milagro.
- This documentation surrounds message types in `code brackets`, and capitalizes DataTypes.
- All numbers are serialized as big endian.
